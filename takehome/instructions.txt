Answer questions 1 - 5 below using only the Biaka_Pygmies population. Question 6 asks you to compute these and other statistics for each of the populations and combine the information in a data.frame. The questions involve the AKT1.C6024T and AKT1.G2347T SNPs (SNP2 & SNP3).

1. Create a cross-tab of genotypes at the two loci - How many haplotypes are pre-determined and how many need to be sorted out via the E-M algorithm?
2. Compute allele frequencies for each locus separately - extract the frequencies in R as p.A, p.a, p.B, & p.b
3. Compute haplotype frequencies for AKT1.C6024T-AKT1.G2347T haplotypes - extract the haplotype frequencies in R in a similar fashion.
4. Use your extracted objects to compute the D, D', and r^2 measures of LD.
5. Verify your results from part 4 using the LD() function.
6. Create an R data.frame that has the following columns
   region     Geographic.area for the population
   population Population name
   snp2.MAF   minor allele frequency at AKT1.C6024T
   snp3.MAF   minor allele frequency at AKT1.G2347T
   HWE.pval2  HWE p-value at AKT1.C6024T
   HWE.pval3  HWE p-value at AKT1.G2347T
   D'         the normalized disequilibrium coefficient
   r^2        the squared correlation measure of LD

Your answers should be in a text file that can be copied and pasted into R. Any non-R code or comments should be preceded by a '#' comment character as below for a non-existent question 7.
